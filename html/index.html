								&emsp;Hello! My name is Zac Foteff and I am a student at Gonzaga University pursing a Bachelor of Science
                                                                focused in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I am interested in pursing careers as a 
                                                                backend software developer, or in the computer/network security field.</br></br>
                                                                &emsp;My Journey with computer science began when I was a freshman in highschool. I discovered a Python
                                                                IDE for iPad called Pythonista during Christmas vacation and experimented with every module I could --
                                                                even though I knew nothing about computer syntax, or what a programming language even was at the time.
                                                                Nevertheless, by the end of the break I was enamoured with the subject of computer science and was certain
                                                                that I had found something that I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Folowing that discovery, I took every computer 
                                                                science class that my highchool offered and continued to expand my knowlege at Gonzaga.</br>

                                                                 &emsp;My learning isn't just limited to the classroom. I spend much of my free time researching and
                                                                designing projects for myself in order to challenge myself and gain practical knowledge of the many different 
                                                                aspects of computer science. You can find a selection of these projects displayed in the Personal Projects

                                                                and its various tools for managing workflow, as well as devolping a good understanding of the Linux
